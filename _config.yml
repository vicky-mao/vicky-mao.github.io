  Hi there, my nameâ€™s Vicky and Iâ€™m a senior consultant in meso-economy arena. I have got rich experience in laying out strategic plans for quite a number of types of projects including policy, industrialization, land & civil issues, etc., providing intellectual support for corporations, governments and NGOs.

  Projects I worked on covered a wide range of topics, from strategy to operations. In a typical engagement, I own a work stream to deliver the end recommendation. Typical activities involve performing analysis of the particular problems as defined for the work stream, including identifying and prioritizing issues for further analysis, synthesizing the insights from the analyses, developing recommendations based on the synthesis, and creating plans to implement the recommendations.

  I am most skilled in <mark>quantitative</mark>, <mark>analytical</mark> and <mark>conceptual</mark> problem-solving.
